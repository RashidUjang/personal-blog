description: I'm a Technical Lead.

I've always had a passion for creating and calling a thing your own and found myself at home in tech. I have a strong fascination for a wide range of topics in software engineering ranging from development, system architecture and distributed systems to DevOps culture and engineering management. Previously, I was an IT consultant in a Business Analyst role and have since transitioned to being a Technical Lead. Outside of work, I enjoy gaming and music.

Currently leading a team building Malaysia's first healthcare marketplace. Hit me up for a chat!
