description: I'm a Senior Software Engineer.

I've always had a passion for creating and calling a thing your own and found myself at home in tech. My fascination in tech spans a diverse range of topics ranging from system architecture and distributed systems to DevOps culture and engineering management to deep learning and neural networks. 

I have held multiple different positions such as a business analyst and technical lead in projects of various scales. However, I have recently transitioned to contributing in an IC (individual contributor) role as a software engineer to really focus on honing my skills and expertise in software development. Outside of work, I enjoy learning, gaming and music.

Currently helping clients build software solutions that provide tangible value to their organizations. Hit me up for a chat!
